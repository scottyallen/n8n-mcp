## [Unreleased]

## [2.34.4] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed

- **MCP Apps: Fix blank UI rendering in Claude**: Rewrote `useToolData` hook to use the official `useApp` hook from `@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps/react` instead of manually managing `App` lifecycle
  - Proper initialization handshake with host via `appInfo` and `capabilities`
  - Handlers registered via `onAppCreated` callback (before `connect()`) to avoid race conditions
  - Removed `app.close()` on unmount which caused issues with React Strict Mode
  - Added visible error and connection states with inline colors for debugging

## [2.34.3] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed

- **MCP Apps: Use correct MIME type for ext-apps spec**: Changed resource MIME type from `text/html` to `text/html;profile=mcp-app` (the `RESOURCE_MIME_TYPE` constant from `@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps`). Without this profile parameter, Claude Desktop/web fails to recognize resources as MCP Apps and shows "Failed to load MCP App: the resource may exceed the 5 MB size limit."

## [2.34.2] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed

- **CI: UI apps missing from npm package**: Release pipeline only ran `npm run build` (TypeScript), so `ui-apps/dist/` was never built and excluded from published packages
  - Changed build step to `npm run build:all` in `build-and-verify` and `publish-npm` jobs
  - Added `ui-apps/dist/` to npm publish staging directory
  - Added `ui-apps/dist/**/*` to published package files list

## [2.34.1] - 2026-02-07

### Changed

- **MCP Apps: Align with official ext-apps spec** for Claude Desktop/web compatibility
  - URI scheme changed from `n8n-mcp://ui/{id}` to `ui://n8n-mcp/{id}` per MCP ext-apps spec
  - `_meta.ui.resourceUri` now set on tool definitions (`tools/list`) instead of tool call responses
  - `UIMetadata.ui.app` renamed to `UIMetadata.ui.resourceUri`
  - Added `_meta` field to `ToolDefinition` type
  - Added `UIAppRegistry.injectToolMeta()` method for enriching tool definitions
  - UI apps now use `@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps` `App` class instead of `window.__MCP_DATA__`
  - Updated `ReadResource` URI parser to match new `ui://` scheme

## [2.34.0] - 2026-02-07

### Added

- **MCP Apps**: Rich HTML UIs rendered by MCP hosts alongside tool results via `_meta.ui` and the MCP resources protocol
  - Server-side UI module (`src/mcp/ui/`) with tool-to-UI mapping and `_meta.ui` injection
  - `UIAppRegistry` static class for loading and serving self-contained HTML apps
  - `UI_APP_CONFIGS` mapping tools to their corresponding UI apps

- **Operation Result UI**: Visual summary for workflow operation tools
  - Status badge, operation type, workflow details card
  - Expandable sections for nodes added, modified, and removed
  - Mapped to: `n8n_create_workflow`, `n8n_update_full_workflow`, `n8n_update_partial_workflow`, `n8n_delete_workflow`, `n8n_test_workflow`, `n8n_autofix_workflow`, `n8n_deploy_template`

- **Validation Summary UI**: Visual summary for validation tools
  - Valid/invalid badge with error and warning counts
  - Expandable error list with type, property, message, and fix
  - Expandable warning list and suggestions
  - Mapped to: `validate_node`, `validate_workflow`, `n8n_validate_workflow`

- **React + Vite Build Pipeline** (`ui-apps/`):
  - React 19, Vite 6, vite-plugin-singlefile for self-contained HTML output
  - Shared component library: Card, Badge, Expandable
  - `useToolData` hook for reading data from `window.__MCP_DATA__` or embedded JSON
  - n8n-branded dark theme with CSS custom properties
  - Per-app builds via `APP_NAME` environment variable

- **MCP Resources Protocol**: Server now exposes `resources` capability
  - `ListResources` handler returns available UI apps
  - `ReadResource` handler serves self-contained HTML via `n8n-mcp://ui/{id}` URIs

- **New Scripts**:
  - `build:ui`: Build UI apps (`cd ui-apps && npm install && npm run build`)
  - `build:all`: Build UI apps then server (`npm run build:ui && npm run build`)

### Changed

- **MCP Server**: Added `resources: {}` to server capabilities alongside existing `tools: {}`
- **Tool Responses**: Tools with matching UI apps now include `_meta.ui.app` URI pointing to their visual representation
- **Graceful Degradation**: Server starts and operates normally without `ui-apps/dist/`; UI metadata is only injected when HTML is available

## [2.33.6] - 2026-02-06

### Changed

- Updated n8n from 2.4.4 to 2.6.3
- Updated n8n-core from 2.4.2 to 2.6.1
- Updated n8n-workflow from 2.4.2 to 2.6.0
- Updated @n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain from 2.4.3 to 2.6.2

- Updated README badge with new n8n version

## [2.33.5] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed

- **Critical memory leak: per-session database connections** (Issue #542): Fixed severe memory leak where each MCP session created its own database connection (~900MB per session)
  - Root cause: `N8NDocumentationMCPServer` called `createDatabaseAdapter()` for every new session, duplicating the entire 68MB database in memory
  - With 3-4 sessions, memory would exceed 4GB causing OOM kills every ~20 minutes
  - Fix: Implemented singleton `SharedDatabase` pattern - all sessions now share ONE database connection
  - Memory impact: Reduced from ~900MB per session to ~68MB total (shared) + ~5MB per session overhead
  - Added `getSharedDatabase()` and `releaseSharedDatabase()` for thread-safe connection management
  - Added reference counting to track active sessions using the shared connection

- **Session timeout optimization**: Reduced default session timeout from 30 minutes to 5 minutes
  - Faster cleanup of stale sessions reduces memory buildup
  - Configurable via `SESSION_TIMEOUT_MINUTES` environment variable

- **Eager instance cleanup**: When a client reconnects, previous sessions for the same instanceId are now immediately cleaned up
  - Prevents memory accumulation from reconnecting clients in multi-tenant deployments

- **Telemetry event listener leak**: Fixed event listeners in `TelemetryBatchProcessor` that were never removed
  - Added proper cleanup in `stop()` method
  - Added guard against multiple `start()` calls

### Added

- **New module: `src/database/shared-database.ts`** - Singleton database manager
  - `getSharedDatabase(dbPath)`: Thread-safe initialization with promise lock pattern
  - `releaseSharedDatabase(state)`: Reference counting for cleanup
  - `closeSharedDatabase()`: Graceful shutdown for process termination
  - `isSharedDatabaseInitialized()` and `getSharedDatabaseRefCount()`: Monitoring helpers

### Changed

- **`N8NDocumentationMCPServer.close()`**: Now releases shared database reference instead of closing the connection
- **`SingleSessionHTTPServer.shutdown()`**: Calls `closeSharedDatabase()` during graceful shutdown

## [2.33.4] - 2026-01-21

### Fixed

- **Memory leak in SSE session reset** (Issue #542): Fixed memory leak when SSE sessions are recreated every 5 minutes
  - Root cause: `resetSessionSSE()` only closed the transport but not the MCP server
  - This left the SimpleCache cleanup timer (60-second interval) running indefinitely
  - Database connections and cached data (~50-100MB per session) persisted in memory
  - Fix: Added `server.close()` call before `transport.close()`, mirroring the existing cleanup pattern in `removeSession()`
  - Impact: Prevents ~288 leaked server instances per day in long-running HTTP deployments

## [2.33.3] - 2026-01-21

### Changed

- **Updated n8n dependencies to latest versions**
  - n8n: 2.3.3 → 2.4.4
  - n8n-core: 2.3.2 → 2.4.2
  - n8n-workflow: 2.3.2 → 2.4.2
  - @n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain: 2.3.2 → 2.4.3

### Added

- **New `icon` property type**: Added support for the new `icon` NodePropertyType introduced in n8n 2.4.x
  - Added type structure definition in `src/constants/type-structures.ts`
  - Updated type count from 22 to 23 NodePropertyTypes
  - Updated related tests to reflect the new type

### Fixed

- Rebuilt node database with 803 nodes (541 from n8n-nodes-base, 262 from @n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain)

## [2.33.2] - 2026-01-13

### Changed

- **Updated n8n dependencies to latest versions**
  - n8n: 2.2.3 → 2.3.3
  - n8n-core: 2.2.2 → 2.3.2
  - n8n-workflow: 2.2.2 → 2.3.2
  - @n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain: 2.2.2 → 2.3.2
  - Rebuilt node database with 537 nodes (434 from n8n-nodes-base, 103 from @n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain)
  - Updated README badge with new n8n version

## [2.33.1] - 2026-01-12

### Fixed

- **Docker image version mismatch bug**: Docker images were built with stale `package.runtime.json` (v2.29.5) while npm package was at v2.33.0
  - Root cause: `build-docker` job in `release.yml` did not sync `package.runtime.json` version before building
  - The `publish-npm` job synced the version, but both jobs ran in parallel, so Docker got the stale version
  - Added "Sync runtime version" step to `release.yml` `build-docker` job
  - Added "Sync runtime version" step to `docker-build.yml` `build` and `build-railway` jobs
  - All Docker builds now sync `package.runtime.json` version from `package.json` before building

## [2.33.0] - 2026-01-08
